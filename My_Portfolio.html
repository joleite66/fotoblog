        <h1>The military Switchâ€¦</h1>

        <p>Since I was a kid, I always thought my dream was to be a Military, so and when I was 18 I decided to join the Portuguese Air Force as an Administrative Secretary. </p> 
        Always waking up early to shine my boots. Everything was fine until after a few years I realize that I was not happy. 
        I was so limited and bored because of the routines of the day that I decided to look for something to fulfil my self. 
        I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.
        <br>
        <br>
        And thatâ€™s when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited.
        <br>
        <br>    
        Looks like it was yesterday that I let everything behind, all my carer and my fear to embrace a new professional and personal experience that I will never forget. I decided to take a risk and chase my dream with in {OportoUNITY} bootcamp at <Academia de CÃ³digo_>!! (I mean really? How could it not be great when you can play around with code, building amazing things, from small projects to a big application and between this you win a Big Family and friends and have great moments programmingâ€¦)
            <br>
            <br>    
        I canâ€™t get enough time for all my ideas, I love to start a project and just let my mind go with the flow. After that, I just create a piece of art :D.
        The best part is the moment you discover a solution for a problem after being there for many hours. Thereâ€™s no better felling than a problem solved.
        <br>
        <br>    
        Now in the industry, this passion remains with me. Thereâ€™s certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
